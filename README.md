## R/Bioconductor for single cell RNAseq data analysis

Date: Friday September 29th

Location: Yawkey Building - YC306/307 

Our Meetup in September will focus on single cell data analysis. Our guest speaker is Jean Fan, who wrote and maintains the PAGODA and SCDE R packages (http://hms-dbmi.github.io/scde/index.html).    Please let us know if you would like to present a lightning talks on normalization, processing, pipeline, analysis etc for scRNA data. 

Talk title: Identifying and characterizing single cell subpopulations with PAGODA using the SCDE package 

Bio: Jean Fan is a PhD Candidate in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at Harvard University in Peter Kharchenkoâ€™s lab at the Department of Biomedical Informatics. Her research interests center around the development of computational approaches for interpreting heterogeneity in single cell populations, particularly in the context of cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. She is the maintainer and developer of SCDE Bioconductor package. Her website is available at http://jef.works/

# About this repo

I will be demoing PAGODA from the `scde` package and also from the new [`PAGODA2` package](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pagoda2) using data from [Camp et al](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/51/15672). Data has been cleaned and provided to you in the `data/` directory. Code to be demo-ed provided in the `R/` folder. Slides in the `docs/` folder.
